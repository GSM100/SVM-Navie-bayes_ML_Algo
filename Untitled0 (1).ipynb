Decision Boundary (Hyperplane)\n","\n","- In 2D space, the decision boundary is a line.\n","\n","- In 3D space, it’s a plane.\n","\n","- In higher dimensions, it’s called a hyperplane.\n","\n","- The goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin (distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points).\n","\n","2. Support Vectors\n","\n","- The data points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors.\n","\n","- They are critical, because if you remove them, the position of the hyperplane changes.\n","\n","- Only these points determine the boundary, not the others.\n","\n","3. Margin Maximization\n","\n","- SVM tries to maximize the margin = distance between the hyperplane and the nearest points of each class.\n","\n","- A larger margin means better generalization and lower risk of overfitting.\n","\n","4. Handling Non-Linearly Separable Data\n","\n","- If the data is not linearly separable, SVM uses the Kernel Trick.\n","\n","- Kernel functions (like Polynomial, RBF/Gaussian, Sigmoid) map data into higher-dimensional space where a linear separation is possible.\n","\n","5. Soft Margin (Handling Noise & Outliers)\n","\n","- Real-world data is often noisy.\n","\n","- SVM introduces a parameter C (regularization):\n","\n","- Large C → strict classification, less tolerance for misclassification.\n","\n","- Small C → allows some misclassification, better generalization."],"metadata":{"id":"_M-hNHcGLxrM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 2: Explain the difference between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM\n","\n","-  Hard Margin SVM\n","\n","- Assumes the dataset is perfectly linearly separable (no overlap, no noise).\n","\n","- The SVM finds a hyperplane that separates the classes without any misclassification.\n","\n","- The margin is maximized and all data points must lie outside or on the margin boundaries.\n","\n","🔹 Advantages:\n","\n","- Simple and works well if data is perfectly clean and separable.\n","\n","🔹 Disadvantages:\n","\n","- Very sensitive to outliers and noise.\n","\n","- If just one point is misclassified, the hard margin solution may fail.\n","\n","Soft Margin SVM :-\n","\n","- Used when data is not perfectly separable (real-world cases).\n","\n","- Introduces a slack variable (ξ) that allows some misclassifications.\n","\n","- Adds a regularization parameter (C) to control trade-off:\n","\n","- Large C → fewer misclassifications (harder margin, risk of overfitting).\n","\n","- Small C → more tolerance to misclassifications (softer margin, better generalization).\n","\n","🔹 Advantages:\n","\n","- Robust to noise and outliers.\n","\n","- Works well in practical datasets that are not perfectly separable.\n","\n","🔹 Disadvantages:\n","\n","- Needs proper tuning of C (regularization)."],"metadata":{"id":"gSMoUXUqMr0Q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Question 3: What is the Kernel Trick in SVM?
